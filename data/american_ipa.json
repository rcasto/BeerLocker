Our brewers have brought their experiments with German hops to fruition, leaving convention behind to create this hefty IPA entirely with pilsner malts. These provide a superbly crisp mouthfeel, while a unique mix of noble and new-school hop varieties adds layers of bright, bitter flavors. Despite the daunting name, this beer isn't designed to bring about the end of the world, but it just might destroy some of your preconceived notions of what an IPA can be.",

The malt character is rich and complex, with hints of cocoa and coffee that don't interfere with the hop intensity. We used one of our favorite new hop varieties, El Dorado, 100 percent in the dry-hop stage, which provides a distinctive lemony character in the aroma and taste that we've come to affectionately describe as \"lemon candy.\"",

Its flavors are almost defiant- a huge nose with hops and malt struggling for control, a bit of oak, just the right carbonation and an insanely long finish worthy of any hop-head.\u201d\r\nIn recognition of their contribution to a crowd-funding campaign at our Ypsilanti Microbrewery location, one of the perks extended to the Rankerts was the opportunity to stop by the brewery and brew the recipe of their choosing.

Similarly, George Hodgson of the Bow Brewery in 1800s London, is commonly credited with inventing \u201cpale ale for India\u201d, what is now known as IPA. \r\n\r\nInstead, according to The Beer Connoisseur, ONLINE, India Pale Ale seems to have developed out of the idea current at least as far back as the 1760s that it was \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d to add extra hops to beer intended to be drunk in hot climates. The Bow Brewery became the dominant shipper of the lighter style beer to India, mostly because of its close proximity to the East India Company docks on the River Thames. Lady Luck strikes again. \r\n\r\nThe Addlehead IPA formula calls for a blending of 5 grains and 3 hops to produce a beer that IPA devotees appreciate but others also find pleasantly tasty. \r\n\r\nAddlehead has a golden yellow color and a full, rich body with a creamy head and a medium lace. It is rated at 95 IBU (International Bitterness Units), but it has a balanced hint of sweetness which is rare in an IPA. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, it retains the signature IPA hoppy finish.",

Questions like \u201cwhat is this?\u201d and \u201cwhere can I get this?\u201d were answered by \u201cIt\u2019s anonymous\u201d creating the buzz for our \u201cAnonymous IPA\u201d. The beer is a blend of six different malts, five different hops and a lot of tender love and care from our brewing team. The maltiness and beautiful darker than average color comes from the Munich, Aromatic and Caramel malts with a splash of pale chocolate malt. The amazing hop flavor and aroma created by the five different hops are going to remain anonymous. So far nobody has figured them out. This brave new beer is brewed by and for innovators. Go ahead. Expect the exceptional. We think you\u2019ll like what\u2019s brewing.",

This balanced IPA bursts forward with a blend of juicy citruses, tropical fruits, and pine resins from five different hops, including Galaxy and Simcoe. A sturdy malt backbone keeps the plethora of Australian and American hops in balance. Did we say \"balance\" enough?",

Just as he brought the new flavor of coffee to the markets of India, we are bringing you this new variety of IPA. We took a true West-coast style IPA and infused it with 40 pounds of locally roasted coffee from Expresso News coffee shop in downtown Boone.

Originally brewed in September of 1992 at the request of three bartenders/managers (who have since gone on to great fame and glory) Big Man Ale has been a favorite seasonal brew at Cambridge Brewing Company ever since. Legend has it that the grist weight of Big Man Ale was their combined total weight \u2013  770 pounds of malt! \r\n\r\nDeep copper-colored and unfiltered (as are all of CBC\u2019s beers), it boasts a full body complemented by strong, robust flavors. Its rich notes of malt and caramel are offset by very aggressive hopping\u2014it is kettle-hopped with Columbus, Cascade and Centennial hops and further dry-hopped with even more Cascades and Amarillo. These hop varieties lend a fruity, citrusy character to this big beer, in the style of a \u201cwinter-ized\u201d I.P.A. We just call it the Big Man. Drink up and be somebody!",

Bitto Honey IPA is a well balanced beer that provides a heavy dose of honey malt and fresh local honey to add a touch of sweetness to the bitter hops. Coming in at 65 IBU's, this IPA also balances the use of hops across the spectrum of bittering, flavoring, and aroma profiles. This provides you with the bitterness of an IPA without killing your tongue and allows you to experience the true beauty of the Amarillo and Cascade hops, their flavor and aroma. \r\n\r\nBecause of the balanced use of hops, Bitto Honey IPA can be enjoyed by beer connoisseurs and novice beer drinkers alike!",

Now we love our IPAs, but it\u2019s downright comical the sheer volume of IPAs out there. There are White IPAs, Black IPAs, Brett IPAs, Oaked IPAs, blah blah blah, English IPAs, west coast IPAs, New England IPAs, blah blah blah, mango-jalapeno IPAs blah blah blah! At the 21A we take our beer very seriously but we don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously. We just want to have fun making great beers, and Blah Blah Blah IPA sure seemed like a good way to do it. Blah Blah Blah IPA is a maltier, amber-colored take of the traditional IPA. We incorporated some interesting malts including imported Baird Caramel 80, a darker, sweet crystal malt; Belgian biscuit malt to give it a toasty flavor; and German dark Munich malt for body and color. We also hopped this ale a bit differently than we normally do with most of the hops being added at different times very late in the boil for a full hop \"jammy\" flavor and bright aroma. We then dry-hopped it very agressively using five different hops including a newer experimental varietal to pack in flavors and aromas of pine, citrus, grapefruit and jam. Blah blah blah, just try it.

We wanted to make our own version so we could drink it as fresh as possible. When we started making Bosko in 2012 fresh American beers weren\u2019t readily available in the U.K. That has changed, and so have the styles of I.P.A. favoured across the pond. The trend is for paler, drier, hop-bombs. Bosko has a more balanced approach because although it is loaded with aromatic American hops it is brewed with crystal malt. This gives it the sweetness characteristic of those beers we were trying to emulate back in the day.\r\n\r\nBosko Absoluto is the Imperial version and at 9% ABV it\u2019s a ramped-up version of Bosko.\r\n\r\nWe photographed Bosko at one of our favourite local bars; Mother Kelly\u2019s in Bethnal Green. There is always a great range of beer on draught and even more bottles in the many fridges. Highly recommended!\r\n\r\nThe Bosko Absoluto label was designed by graffiti artist Coby Walsh.

Everyday English ales were spoiling during shipment from London, around Africa\u2019s Cape of Good Hope, to Calcutta. Using extra malt and hops, British brewer George Hodgson developed an ale with the bitterness and strength to endure the long sea voyage, giving rise to a great beer style. Our East India Pale Ale is a deep golden beer brewed from British malt and a blend of hops featuring the choice East Kent Golding variety. It is traditionally dry-hopped for a bright aroma of hops, lemongrass, pine and citrus fruit, and has a robust bitterness, a warming malt palate and a clean hoppy finish. We think Hodgson would be rather pleased.",

It was bred as a hybrid of a number of different hops, including Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fch, U.S. Tettnanger, East Kent Golding, Bavarian, Brewers Gold, and other unknown hops. The resulting hop, Citra, has a distinct citrusy and tropical fruit flavor and aroma. In Citra ass down we used American Columbus for bittering and 11# of Citra at the end of the boil for late kettle addition flavor and aroma. Then we added 6 more pounds Citra and 5# Centennial post fermention for aroma. Rebrewed for your tasting pleasure!",

That\u2019s why we sought out to synthesize a beer that was masterfully crafted to accentuate a massive American Citrus hop profile while retaining our standards for balance, and sophistication.\r\n\r\nThrough various test batches, water profile manipulation, and uncommon hopping techniques, we found a way to offer you what we feel is the epitome of the American Citrus hop in a glass.\r\nThe utilization of Citra, Simcoe, Mosaic, and an experimental hop we like to call \u201cLemonBomb\u201d, give \u201cCitrus\u201d huge flavors and aromas of grapefruit, blood orange, pine, passionfruit, mango, and pink guava, balanced by a clean malt bill of Belgium\u2019s finest pilsner malt and our neutral American yeast.\r\n\r\nThis will forever and always be our go-to IPA and we hope it becomes yours as well.",

It will pour a nice deep copper color with a bit of haziness. Because of our almost patented \"Intense Transfer Methods\" our Crooked Tree has won several medals in the India Pale Ale category.",

It\u2019s a flavorful, cutting-edge, modern-day IPA for everyone. Lemondrop and El Dorado hops provide plenty of fruity citrus character and a burst of hop zing that sings on the palate.

British soldiers and civil servants were stationed all over the globe (including India), and regular ales could not survive the long journey by sea to reach them.

A solid malt base, however, tempers the bitter American hops, giving Dragonfly a balance not often found in this style.

Recently the 'More is More!' camp have moved this noble style ever in the direction of increased alcohol and bitterness, flashy new hop varieties, and a tendency towards one-upsmanship. We've taken a step back, thought about what makes a great every-day IPA, and returned to our beloved NW IPA's roots. Hops include classic varieties, including Cascade, Nugget and Willamette, with modern varieties Apollo and Zythos reflecting a nod to the future. ESB, Crystal 40, Special Aromatic, Wheat, Carahell, and Sour malts. Dryhopped and ran through several pounds of whole leaf Cascade in our hopback, Eagle Harbor presents a firm hop aroma, supported by enough malt character to keep you coming back for more.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY: As the story goes, India Pale Ale was a big, hoppy beer designed to survive passage in a ship's hold all the way to India. Eagle Harbor is the bay that Downtown Winslow adjoins and the location of the ferry terminal. Interestingly, Winslow was not the main settlement on the island for much of its history. Searching for a new harbor to build ever larger ships, in 1903 the Hall Brothers Shipyard relocated from Port Blakely to Eagle Harbor. The tiny settlement of Madrone was then renamed Winslow, after the deceased Winslow Hall. Eagle Harbor IPA is named for that fading dream of enormous five-masted schooners, sailing to distant shores.",

After the partying settled we took to Facebook to let our followers and regular customers choose the official name for the beer. Suggestions piled in with hundreds of entries! While we were narrowing down the names, on the weekend of April 26, Erik was taken from this world. As a warrior and friend, we\u2019ve decided to immortalize his memory in Valh\u00f6ll. The Sweet IPA, will now forever bare the name: Erik\u2019s Sweet IPA.

        "description": "Portsmouth is a colonial era seaport town, so it goes to follow that sooner or later we'd brew an India Pale Ale as a tribute to those big, hoppy 19th century ales that made the long sea voyage from England's temperate shores, 'round the Cape of Good Hope, to the sultry climes of the faraway East Indies.\r\n\r\nBut there's another reason we brewed this beer, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads. \r\n\r\nTen years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: \u201cWhy don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?\u201d\r\n\r\nYou could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think they\u2019ll be quite pleased.",

Generous amounts of Citra and Centennial hops remind you that it's still an \"India\" style beer nonetheless.",

The same spirit that sent pathfinders, like Captain Cook, sailing from Britain to the shores of Australia and the rocky coastlines of Alaska animates today's trailblazers. Wherever you find a frontier, be it the Final Frontier of our Milky Way, the Last Frontier of the Great Land, or the frontiers of scientific knowledge, there you will also find dedicated men and women, taking risks to break trail for the rest of us.\r\nOne of the new trails being blazed on the frontier of beer is the style known as White India Pale Ales. Galaxy White IPA represents a significant new landmark on that trail. With its use of fresh kumquats, Indian coriander, and black peppercorns, Galaxy pays homage to the early explorers, who sailed unknown seas in search of rare spices and exotic fruits. Captain Cook travelled from Australia to Alaska, and so have the Galaxy hops used to create this adventurous brew. Just as a true explorer never stands still, the presence of brettanomyces guarantees that Galaxy White IPA will keep evolving in the bottle for years to come.\r\nSo take a step from the known into the unknown. Cross the frontier from the commonplace into the extraordinary. Be the first to gaze upon an undiscovered country and return to tell the tale to those timid souls you left behind. After all, there's an entire Galaxy waiting to be explored\u2026",

Groves had a reputation as a strong and bitter leader, so we found it appropriate to name our IPA after this great man.\r\n\r\nGeneral Groves is a big American IPA; bold, assertive, and full of flavor highlighting the complex citrus and herbal character of our Northwest hops.  The brewer of this IPA takes hops pretty seriously, which is why he added more hops to this IPA than any other IPAs we have produced. He spent a lot of time tinkering, tasting, and tweaking this recipe to get the biggest and best hop flavors and aromas into this beer. His diligence has paid off.

This beer is all about the hops; we use a blend of five different varieties all grown in the Pacific Northwest.  A small charge of Chinook and Columbus early in the boil adds a smooth bitterness.  A majority of the hops are then added late in the kettle or post-fermentation to produce a beer that is heavy on hop flavor and aroma.  The combination of Cascade, Centennial, Citra and Columbus give Head High a noticeable grapefruit flavor with aromas of citrus, tropical fruits and pine.  Our house American ale yeast ferments to a dry finish that accentuates the use of imported Pilsner and lightly kilned crystal malt resulting in Head High\u2019s straw color and crisp flavor.",

When this happens, there are days when the tide just gets too high and flattens out the surf. The lineups shut down and surfers are left to wait until the High Tide recedes.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the tides to shift in your favor, might we suggest a High Tide IPA?\r\n\r\nBrewed only once each year to coincide with the Hop Harvest in Yakima Washington, High Tide IPA is made with 180 lbs of Fresh Hops per batch that are plucked from the vines and sent straight to our brewery. We skip the whole drying and processing stage which means the hops are ultra fresh and full of flavors we can\u2019t normally get. Like grapes, Hops are only harvested one time each year and as such, we make what we can when we get them.\r\n\r\nThe recipe is very simple and basic with an emphasis on the variety of hops we select each year. Lately, we have selected Centennial and Chinook hops for our High Tide IPA. We used Centennial at the end of the boil and Chinook for the Dry Hopping. Now that we have brewed High Tide, we will sit and wait for the ultra High Tides of Fall to arrive knowing full well that we have sufficient stocks of great beer to get us through the flattest of sessions. We hope you\u2019ll stock up too.",

Every time I brew this beer I get excited for the spicy, citrus aroma thats released when the hops are added to the brew kettle. It\u2019s almost overwhelming since there are around a pound and a half of hops per barrel. To round out all that hoppiness we use oats in the mash, it adds a little bit of sweetness but also creates a little bit of a heavier mouthfeel. Since there is so much interplay between the hops and the malt we didn\u2019t want any of it to get muddled up with the yeast and fermentation process so we went with a standard yeast strain on this brew. If you\u2019re looking to pair this beer up with something to eat, I recommend something on the spicier side.",

Driven to the edge of extinction by the decades long practice of American brewers putting as few hops as possible in their beer, the Hopadillo has begun to thrive again now that craft brewers like Karbach Brewing Company are generously hopping their beers.  You see, the Hopadillo needs a certain compound found only in hops in order to survive.   Of course, you\u2019re thinking that the Hopadillo should simply live in the major hop growing regions of the world. Problem is this compound the Hopadillo needs must be in a metabolized form found only in humans after they have consumed highly hopped beer. \r\n\r\nSo why has the Hopadillo been spotted more in Texas than in other parts of the US where the resurgence of well hopped beers has been underway for years now?  For one, Hopadillos seem to prefer a warmer climate.  They also seem to like when a variety of American and European hops are used in the process.  Rumor has it that is exactly what the boys down at Karbach are doing.  Despite the fact that one of Karbach\u2019s employees disappeared one night after having a couple of the IPAs after work, they continue to brew this beer, undeterred by the traces of the employee\u2019s DNA from an \u201cunidentifiable\u201d organism found in the brewery parking lot.",

Lacking reliable refrigeration, brewers produced these ales with large amounts of hops and alcohol, which acted as preservatives in order to make the long voyage.  Here we\u2019ve produced a strong, bold and fruity India Pale Ale in the tradition of the fine West Coast breweries. It is sure to please the hoppiest of hopheads. We start with 5 different malts to create a sturdy foundation for the hop assault. Then we build on this foundation with Bravo, Columbus and Centennial hops for bitterness and flavor. The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the generous addition of a Cascade and Simcoe dry hop for a huge citrus and apricot aroma. Cheers!",

The devilish forces of alcohol and bitterness, 7.5% ABV and 70 IBU\u2019s, could overwhelm but, as with all our beers, the angelic forces of subtlety and the sublime element of balance are also present. The grain bill is redolent with the complexity of rye malt, lightly toasted crystal and victory malts. The 90 minute boil both caramelizes and concentrates the wort. Large helpings of bittering hops up front are complimented by Cascade late in the kettle. Centennial and Cascade dry hops develop a pleasing floral and citrus aroma. \r\n\r\n While we Humbly ask your indulgence, we are confident that this ale is a Legit IPA in the best West Coast tradition. We hope you enjoy it!",

Because the ships had to cross the equator twice to get there, spoilage was a major problem until some clever brewer realized that both alcohol and hops are natural preservatives. James brews Hurricane I.P.A. in this tradition, and packs it with enough hops and alcohol to survive crossing the orbit of Mercury twice. The grist is 100% Gambrinus premium 2-row barley malt, copiously hopped with fresh Centennial and Willamette. The result is a rich, golden, intense beer with bitterness in perfect balance with residual sweetness.",

We really admire the profile of this new style but wanted a session strength version. We brewed ours at 4.5% instead of the typical 8%+, but wanted to retain the unique flavour profile. We sourced the special malt required from Germany and the hops from America to create a beer of stunning depth and complexity. The beer is black in appearance but lacks the acrid flavours associated with all other dark beers. This is achieved through use of the special German malt. The hop aromas and flavours are very intense, which we achieve through a major dose of dry-hopping in the cask. The result is a beer that wraps all the wonderful hop profiles of a pale ale inside a silky black exterior. It is truly an Illusion that deceives your eyes and dazzles your taste buds. Due to the rare nature of these special ingredients it is a limited release beer, but we are looking at making it more regularly available if possible.",

Our version of an IPA is totally inspired by the reinterpretations that you find particularly on the West Coast.\r\n \r\nA solid malt base combined with humlerne Simcoe, Amarillo and Cascade and then just dry hopped also to ensure that the hops burn through properly. It is fruity and fresh, it is bitter as hell and it's strong enough to give you a little bimmelim, if you drink a few bottles or three.\r\n \r\nHow we conduct a real IPA amarkansk style.

The solution to making their Pale Ale arrive without spoiling was to add additional hops (a natural preservative) and increase the amount of grain to give it a higher alcohol content. Thus, the Imperial Pale Ale (IPA) was born and has gone on to become one of the most popular beer styles in the world.\r\n\r\nOur West Coast-style Jagged Edge IPA recipe takes the hop factor to the next level, perfectly balancing it with hearty English malts to give it the zesty backbone of a bold IPA. This is a brew that can take on assertive dishes with lots of spice and heat as well as richer foods like creamy pastas. Push your taste buds to the Jagged Edge! \r\n\r\nJagged Edge IPA is available in bottles and kegs at quality retailers, pubs and restaurants throughout Northern California and Nevada.",

The answer, embodied in this IPA when we first released it in 2011, was something truly magnificent, delicious and well worth brewing again. But what if we changed it up a bit? This time around, we exchanged Pacifica hops from New Zealand for Helga hops from Australia. The result is an IPA that\u2019s as bright, herbaceous and bitingly hoppy as the one that\u2019s had our fans requesting its return ever since its depletion from store shelves, but with a modern, hop-driven twist that makes this second draft unique and tasty in its own right.",

Due to the time it took to reach the shores of India, and the heat along the way, that beer often spoiled. The brewers knew that hops are a preservative against infection, as is alcohol, and by increasing the amount of both, they could make a beer that could survive the long voyage. Thus was the birth of India Pale Ales, a very hoppy and bitter ale with a higher alcohol content. The American versions of this style use American hops which impart a floral, citrusy aroma and a powerful hop bitterness. Brewed with 2-row pale ale, caramel malts and American grown hops from the Northwest.",

We had such great success with the IPAs coming out of our Pilot facility (in both our \"Farmhouse Ales\" - brewery only - and \"Brown Bag\" - regionally distributed, draught-only) that we decided to release Limbo IPA, in package and draught, year-round.\r\n\r\nWhen we launched Brown Bag in 2012, a web page dedicated to customer feedback was put online. After experiencing the first IPA in the series, one customer's email remarked, \"You'd better not leave me sitting here in Limbo until you decide to brew some of your new IPA's year-round.\" And so became Limbo.\r\n\r\nAt 80 IBU's, we knew this Australian & West Coast hopped IPA warranted packaging that was equally as bold, so we broke the Long Trail mold and went to some unchartered territory. The package graphics and tap handles are like nothing we have ever done before and are sure to turn some heads. Limbo six packs will have a special die-cut design to showcase the artwork. The bottle will feature unique crowns with artwork on both sides. This style of IPA is something we have heard our customers screaming for and our Brewers have hit this recipe out of the park.",

The beer is jet black in color with a crema-like head. The Citra, Centennial and Magnum hops contribute citrus and floral aromas and aggressive hop flavors. We use generous amounts of dark malt for balance alongside the hop character, which create a complex texture and flavors with a satisfying finish.\r\n\r\nLong Black Veil was originally introduced in October 2014 to coincide with the anniversary of the death of its namesake. The name of the beer was inspired by Alexandria\u2019s famous mystery of the veiled Female Stranger. In 1816, a young woman who had fallen ill was brought ashore from a ship at Alexandria\u2019s port and her husband never removed the thick veil she wore to conceal her identity. They moved into Room 8 at Gadsby\u2019s Tavern and her husband swore the doctor and nurses to secrecy. After two months, she died in his arms on October 14, and he himself prepared and buried her body in a cemetery at the edge of Old Town. The identity of this veiled \u201cFemale Stranger\u201d remains a mystery to this day.\r\n\r\nThis is the first production-scale beer to be developed by Port City Brewers Josh Center and Adam Reza, under supervision of Head Brewer Jonathan Reeves.\u2028",

Plenty of the finest American-grown hops are then introduced at every stage of the brewing process. Massive additions of hops in the boil kettle produce a smooth yet assertive finish. \r\n\r\nIn a technique called hop-backing, the boiling wort is pumped over more fresh hops on its way to the fermenter - this lends huge hop flavor. Finally, the addition of whole cone hops into the conditioning tank imparts a hops-bursting-out-of-the-glass aroma, rounding out a complete hop sensory experience!",

Bready malts provide some backbone but ultimately are no match for the smooth hop bitterness. The American yeast supplies mild, fruity esters that ease back and allow the hops to take their rightful place in the spotlight.\r\nHistory & Style\r\n\r\nThe India Pale Ale (IPA) style was first brewed in England. Pale, assertively hopped and strong, over time the style became malty and weaker in alcohol. Early American craft brewers reinvented the IPA using American hop varieties, which gave the style its bold signature citrus and pine aroma.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes\r\n\r\nAromas of tangerine and pine hit the nose first, and then are joined by a spicy and floral hop bouquet, mingled with tropical fruit. The taste is of sweet, juicy hops with flavours of citrus and pine, followed by a smooth bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Bready malts provide just enough balance to make this IPA thoroughly enjoyable sip after sip.",

        "description": "In April 2013 we inked a deal with ArtPrize that made us the official brewery of the competition for the next five years. The premier leadership sponsorship deal included offering our beer at all official ArtPrize events, signage, promotion, merchandise, specialized glassware and other items. It also included permission for us to use the ArtPrize identity marks (logo and graphics) on any co-packaged items, including beer. We plan to release a new beer for each year of our five-year partnership with ArtPrize under the name \u201cArtist Series\u201d. This is year two. Last year\u2019s release was Inspired Artist Black IPA.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaking a unique beer in honor of ArtPrize has become a fun challenge for our brewers,\u201d said Dave Engbers, our co-founder and vice president of brand and education. \u201cThis year\u2019s release just fell into place. Ninkasi\u2014a stained glass ArtPrize submission that showed in our taproom last year\u2014became a permanent part of our taproom when we purchased it last year. We knew right away that it would make a perfect label for Mosaic Promise, a beautifully simple beer that we had been experimenting with for some time.\u201d\r\n\r\nMosaic Promise showcases a single malt\u2014Golden Promise\u2014and a single hop\u2014Mosaic. The traditional barley\u2019s depth of flavor and the versatility of the hops\u2019 bittering, flavor and aroma characteristics are the strong pillars that comprise the structure of this clean, rich, golden beer. We can brew complex beers with the best of them, but we recognize that there\u2019s also beauty in simplicity. The beer clocks in at 5.5% ABV and 50 IBUs.\r\n\r\nProceeds from the sale of Mosaic Promise will support the future programming of the ArtPrize organization. ArtPrize is an international art competition, open to any artist and decided by public vote. Its mission is to promote critical dialogue and collaboration through new, creative ideas among a large and diverse population of people. As an innovator in redefining what beer can be, we believe that experimentation is central to the human experience\u2014whether one experiments with grains and hops or colored glass and light\u2014and that sharing one\u2019s creation with the public is a brave act worth celebrating.\r\n\r\n\u201cFounders is an iconic brand producing a sublime range of exquisite beers in our own Grand Rapids,\u201d said Christian Gaines, executive director of ArtPrize. \u201cWe\u2019re honored and elated to count Founders as the ArtPrize Official Brewery and to include Mosaic Promise as the latest special release beer\u2014one that\u2019s emblematic of our strong partnership and shared commitment to art, artists and community.\u201d\r\n\r\nMore than 400,000 people are expected to attend ArtPrize 2014.\r\n\r\nWe also partnered with ArtPrize to launch ArtPrize on Tap, the newest ArtClub membership perk. From the patios of the Centennial Room, our private second-floor entertainment space, ArtPrize on Tap offers ArtClub members the opportunity to connect year-round and stay on the ArtPrize insider track, while enjoying Founders food and beer. We will premiere Mosaic Promise at the August installment of ArtPrize on Tap. Held on the third Wednesday of every month, ArtPrize on Tap is free for ArtClub members, and friends of ArtPrize and Founders can join for $10. To learn more, go to artprize.org/artclub.\r\n\r\nMosaic Promise will be available for a limited time starting on Sunday, September 14, across our Michigan, Wisconsin, metro NYC and Chicagoland distribution footprint. It will be released in our taproom on draft and in bottles starting on Tuesday, September 16. There will be an event in our taproom featuring the artists and introducing the beer from 4:30-6:30pm that day. One-of-a-kind Mosaic Promise posters will be given away, while supplies last. Mosaic Promise will also be featured at official ArtPrize events.\r\n\r\nThis year marks the sixth edition of ArtPrize, which will take place Sept. 24\u2013Oct. 12, 2014. Our taproom will be a venue for the sixth year running.",

There will be certain elements of the beer that will remain constant. The first batch in 2011 was brewed with Westmalle yeast, Galaxy hops from Australia, Nelson Sauvin hops from New Zealand. Additional additions of Lemon Verbena and Start Anise were added in the whirlpool. The beer had an enormous dank nose and a high level of finishing dryness and bitterness from the Lemon Verbena.  The 2012 batches followed a similar malt bill to the first batch but a different strain of Belgian yeast from the Ardenne region was chosen. A slightly lower level of Lemon Verbena was used and the hops chosen were Green Bullet and Mouteka both from New Zealand. Released for SF Beer Week 2012. Starting in 2013 we have switched over to an American Ale yeast strain but the focus on Southern Hemisphere hops is still a predominant feature of this beer. I hope you enjoy this seasonal treat.

Both malts are premium English malts and each hop is an experimental varietal grown in the Yakima Valley. If these hops prove successful commercially, they will be assigned names. Until then, the hops are simply known as 07270 and 06277.\r\nOperation Collaboration pours with a thick, dense, off-white head atop a golden orange colored beer. The head leaves a healthy lacing in the glass as it is enjoyed. The aroma is dank, but with subtle hints of citrus and juicy fruit. The moderate bitter character allows the hop flavors to shine though with an abundance of tropical orange, pineapple, grapefruit and tangerine-like flavors. The mouthfeel is creamy smooth and the finish exceptional \u2013 pleasant tropical flavors linger on the palette long after your last drink.

Dry hopping (adding hops directly to the tank during the fermentation process) helps to further accentuate the wonderful and unique aromas of the six American hop varieties.\r\n\r\nLook for huge flavor and aroma from Outrage Ale with a noticeable \u201ckick\u201d from the alcohol content.",

After several months of hearing requests (and even pleas) to add an IPA to our line-up, we released the Panic IPA in August 2012.\r\n \r\nPanic IPA is heavily hopped with modern American hop royalty, featuring: Amarillo, Centennial, Crystal and Simcoe flavor and aroma hop additions.  The result is an IPA that includes subtle citrus characteristics and not-so-subtle stone fruit notes as well.  After several special releases, we have fully committed to Panic IPA as one of our regular releases.  If you haven\u2019t had a chance to enjoy a pint or two of this amazing beer, head down to Track 7 and give it a try.  Panic optional.",

We enjoyed the experience so much the first time around that we happily pressed Control+C (Command+C for Mac), and Reboot was born. Version 2.0 has upgraded its spicy aroma, with hints of bubblegum and clove. Bold flavors will launch upon uncorking, as sage and lemongrass balance the tangy, zesty wheat malt profile. Rather than merely blending a wittier with an IPA, Reboot harmonizes distinctly fruity Belgian yeast overtones with big, fruity American hop notes by creating an herbal bridge between these two somewhat contradictory flavors. The beer's complexity os supported by a spritzy effervescence, finishing dry, with lingering hop notes.",

Rye adds a spicy note while Aromatic malt adds a more subtle flavor than C-60 but increases malt aroma.\r\n\r\n\u2022 We lowered the mash rest temperature a few degrees, giving the final beer less body and more drinkability.\r\n\r\n\u2022 We jacked up the dry hopping to four times the level of Finest Kind for big hop aroma.",

        "description": "In August, 2011, Hardywood Park Craft Brewery pioneered a new concept in collaborative brewing: community hopped beer. We had always believed that if we were going to brew an IPA, that it better be extraordinary. Continuing a tradition from our home brewing roots, when neighbors and friends grew hops to contribute to our annual fresh-hopped IPA, we reached out to Richmond's very passionate beer community to invite home hop growers to donate some of their fresh harvest. Sure enough, they came through. With fresh hop contributions from local home growers, Hardywood RVA IPA captures the terroir of Richmond and the spirit of its hop growing beer enthusiasts. A wet-hopped, American-style India Pale Ale with loads of fresh local Columbus, Cascade, Chinook, Centennial and Glacier hops, Hardywood RVA IPA displays a toasted auburn color with a vibrant, creamy head. Cedar, citrus and herbal notes pervade the aroma, while the flavor offers a floral character and a delightful, resinous mouthfeel that can only be achieved with an assertive dose of freshly harvested hops. Medium- to full-bodied, Hardywood RVA IPA finishes with lingering hints of grapefruit and honey. While only 40 gallons of the inaugural RVA IPA were brewed on the pilot brewery in 2011, Hardywood plans to offer local gardeners free hop rhizomes each spring with educational materials on growing and harvesting hops, and the hope for a portion of their bounty at harvest time. We're hopeful that Hardywood RVA IPA will not only evolve as a unique annual beer offering, but as a fun, community building experience. Special thanks to our 2011 hop contributors: Sean Thomas-Pumphrey, Lindsay Weiford, Karl Elchinger, Nick Walthall and Taylor Chenery.",

Elissa has huge hop additions in the kettle that give it a wonderful bitterness and is then dry-hopped in the fermenter to create the pleasant floral, hoppy nose. Our reverse osmosis water makes the bitter very soft with no harsh notes to it. The maltiness is derived from British Maris Otter malt. Its rich flavor stands up to the hops that would otherwise dominate this beer. The Elissa is an authentic version of an India Pale Ale (IPA) style.\r\n\r\nRecommended pairings: Any style of seafood, Indian food, & spicy Thai.",

Galaxy hops are typically used as late additions to accentuate its flavor and aromatic qualities.\r\n\r\nAs a hop varietal, Galaxy has citrus, peach, and passion fruit flavors.

This brew is a little bitter, but bitter like a grapefruit with three tablespoons of sugar on top. It\u2019s also incredibly drinkable. The oddity that\u2019ll keep you tipping the glass is that as this citrus peel front subsides, you actually gleen the sweet flavours of the Victory and Crystal malts. Then, as the bread-puddin\u2019 bicuity sweetness of the malts are chased by the dry, tropical flavour of Citra and the fruit punch bouquet is all in your face with each sip, it\u2019s all is so damn intriguing, you\u2019ll be driven to keep on sampling...and sampling.",

Presa brewery, the decision was easy: Soul Doubt--our Third Coast IPA--exemplifies both the pioneering spirit of American craft brewing tradition and the stubborn ideals of Texas rebellion in one beer.\r\n\r\nWhat is Third Coast IPA, you ask? It\u2019s Texas terroir--grit, hard-scrabble farming, sacrifice and lean living. It\u2019s bottom-dragging inner tubes on rain-thirsty rivers, driving endlessly across the desert to make the Chisos Mountains by dusk, and spring farm-to-markets adorned with Bluebonnets, Black-eyed Susans and Indian Paintbrush. Third Coast IPA is Texas contrariness in a can. The parched Edwards Escarpment poised precariously along the Texas Hill Country--striking stark contrast between the richness and the ruggedness of our great state.\r\n\r\nSoul Doubt Third Coast IPA: designed to enlighten, enliven, and enrich your palate, as well as your soul. Water from the Edward\u2019s Aquifer provides the canvas; a combination of pils, pale and rationed use of caramel malts paints Soul Doubt\u2019s pale color and light mouth-feel. Minimal early hop additions lend a clean, subversive bitterness while our massive late additions of Amarillo and Cascade hops provide a bounty of citrus, orchard fruit, lost pine and wildflower flavor and aroma in the finish.

However, when it comes to the Stone Anniversary Ales, it's all us. Yet, it is indeed still a collaboration with great creative brewers (if we do say so ourselves). We're talking about our own brewing team, of course. And while some of our beers, anniversary and otherwise, have been designed by a single person, the Stone 16th Anniversary IPA was definitely a team effort.\r\n\r\nThis year our brewing team was inspired by some exotic-ish additions of the lemony persuasion. Yes, it's a Double IPA (can you really say you're surprised?), but as we strive to do with all our Stone Anniversary Ales of the let's-take-this-IPA-in-a-new-direction variety, we've brewed up a Stone-worthy divergence from tradition. The amount of rye malt we used isn't quite enough to warrant the appellation \"Rye IPA,\" but it still adds hints of spiciness that contrast deliciously with the tropical fruit flavors and aromas of the Amarillo and Calypso hops. Add a few European specialty malts, some lemon verbena, and three more hop varieties to the mix, and you have a highly complex brew melding both bitter and fruity hop notes with rich toasted malt character punctuated by nuances of spicy rye and subtle lemon.",

Its bitterness hits our sweet spot. Its blackness lightens our hearts. Its liquid dichotomy pulls it all together in this sublimely sacrosanct ale. Yes, we damn well know our stuff here at Stone, and it would be irresponsible of us not to acknowledge how remarkable this heavenly creation of ours is.

Too often, we allow our modesty to get the best of us as we're simply not inclined towards senseless braggadocio. When you're good, you're good.

In this case, we find that we are compelled to point out how amazing this ale is that we rightly call the Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale.\r\n\r\nFirst brewed in 2007 as the Stone 11th Anniversary Ale, this ale was an instant hit. With us. Other folks with great taste loved it too, but we were focused on how much we liked it, and we felt it was truly sublime. That euphoria didn't last long though, as it was soon replaced with the grim reality that when we sold out of it there wouldn't be any more. For us. And that was simply unacceptable. So, we are now blessing ourselves, and you the enlightened, with this ale. Thusly, you may now revel in your own self-righteousness as you see fit with this glorious example of ours.

Knowing that alcohol and hops are natural preservatives, English brewers developed these strong, highly hopped ales known as India Pale Ales. McMenamins Sunflower IPA was first introduced in the summer of 1995 at our West Linn brewery. Inspired by the bountiful sunflowers grown in the pub's beer garden, our IPA has a deep golden color and distinct yet subtle citrus flavors that satisfy both the diehard IPA drinker and those who prefer a lighter palate. Sunflower IPA is truly a beer for the masses. McMenamins artists Lyle Hehn, Myrna Yoder and Jenny Joyce were each asked to design a label for the new IPA. What resulted was three incredibly beautiful yet dissimilar ideas. Rather than choose one label, we will issue three different bottles!",

The idea, however, was to start from two different postulates: on the one hand as I wanted a beer session (i.e. a low alcohol beer), on the other hand I wanted to use a single malt type that would never had to change from one beer to another. As malt I chose the Prince of floor malt English: the Maris Otter, from fantastic note, fragrant and tasty bread. There is no need for tricks when you want to be talked about only raw materials, then a single malt (the Maris Otter in fact), a single yeast (US-05, widespread wings and strain rather neutral) and of course a single hops. This beer will always be produced in limited quantities and will be available only seasonally, every time we use a variety of different hops.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme name Ratio signifies the Supreme Law of the IPA, the summa ratio from which descends every thing.",

A malty sweet, bready amber backdrop props up a balanced hop profile with hints of orange, tangerine, and melon.

You think you're so cool, lovin' all them hops--all that grassy goodness.  You hopheads talk a lot.  Maybe too much.  Instead of blathering on way too long about why IPAs are the greatest beer style ever brewed and blah, blah, blah....you should stop with the talkie and start with the drinkie.....\r\n \r\nOur American-style IPA (India Pale Ale for long), is brewed with....ah, the hell with it.  I'm not even gonna talk about the the malt.  Let's get right to what you addicts wanna hear about--HOPS! \r\n \r\nCentennial hops give this medium amber colored ale delicious notes of grapefruit, pine, and resin.  Higher gravity lends this beer a noticeable alcohol warmth and a smooth, medium-bodied mouthfeel.  It's a little chewier than it's APA sibling.\r\n \r\nCascade hops--that's right, I said CASCADE hops--give your nose something to smile about.  Multiple hop additions insure that if you are a hoplover, you're gonna smell 'em.  And if that ain't good enough for you, after we're done cooking the stuff, we add ourselves a big ol' bag of dry, whole-leaf Centennial AND Cascade hops to the beer during fermentation to give you that custom hop sauce (spoken with anger), we know you crave!\r\n \r\nThis beer leaves session territory and lands squarely in Big Country....Big Flavor Country, that is.  This beer is near and dear to our hearts.  Squeeze your size 42s into a Tire Swing and sip this heavenly brew to understand why.",

This brew has a slightly dry finishing that leaves you wanting another sip. \r\n\r\nNotable Ingredients:\r\n\r\n Grist:\r\nMaris Otter (a higher quality English pale 2-row malt, base malt.  Precieved to be less harsh than its American counterpart) \r\nVictory Malt (Toasty, biscuty, bready quality malt.  This malt is slightly roasted to increase these flavors)\r\n\r\nHops: \r\nFalconers Flight: (a proprietary blend created by Hop Union.  Great aromatic properties, showcasing tropical, citrus, and floral notes) \r\nFalconers 7C\u2019s: (The citrus/grapefruit character associated with Cascade and Centennial is there, alongside fruity, spicy, and earthy notes that make for a complex impression.)",

Despite the wall of tropical fruit aromas you need to head-but your way through to take a sip, the mouthful is medium bodied and refreshing. The bitterness is bitey with a medium-high carbonation emphasising the piquancy. However, the resiny character to the hops and the subtle caramel \r\nmalt takes the edge off the bitter. The 6% alcohol content is barely detectable with only the slightest boozy-prickle. The perfect sessional beer.",

Hops produce an overabundance of hop cones and we were there for the picking. Even after 22 lbs, we hardly put a dent in the yield! So...here we are 3 weeks later, the beer is on tap and it is the freshest...hoppiest...flavorful beer you can imagine! Needless to say, we are proud of this beauty from the ground, up! We wanted a full-flavored IPA, so Bryan suggested we use our Requiem IPA recipe, and calculate for fresh, whole hop cones. Worked beautifully!! We ended up with an IPA with so much up-front flavor you would think you are enjoying a high octane Imperial! Instead, this is a middle-of-the-road IPA, at 5.2% abv!! This just goes to show how a hugely flavorful IPA can be loaded-up with fresh ingredients and come out the other end, a tasty LOW octane, treat! Bryan and I hope you get to stop in soon to try this one out! We decorated Bube's with some of the actual hop vines we pulled from. For the true hophead, you will be in heaven. And for the all-around beer enthusiasts, we hope you can appreciate the creativity in this beer. I know I'm proud to say I had a hand in this one!!",

        "description": "This is a Northwest take on a resurrected beer style that dates back to the British colonial empire of the 1800's. As the story goes, the style was created so that the beer would survive the long journey to India on one of the British East India ships. A beer with more hops and higher alcohol content will go longer before spoiling due to its higher resistance to bacteria and mold growth. Hops have an antibiotic effect that acts against bacterial strains while leaving brewer's yeast relatively unaffected. As a result, IPA has lots of hops.\r\n\r\nTBB's IPA is malted towards the dry side, making it quite quaffable (yes, that's a technical term) rather than malty and hard to get through. It is quite pale in color and has a slightly toasted malt character. Five different hops are used during the brewing and dry-hopping for this IPA, giving it a moderately complex aroma with strong citrus and floral notes.",

In 1993, we repurposed a small corner of our brewery and began distilling whiskey from a mash of 100% rye malt. We call it Old Potrero\u00ae. Although we've experimented with beer and hops in the distillery, we've never used rye or sour mash in the brewery\u2014until now. This Zymaster, Potrero Hill Sour-Mash IPA, begins in our distillery, where we prepare a 100% rye malt mash just as we would for our rye whiskey. After transferring it to a small open fermenter, we pitch the yeast and wait. Five days later, we mash it in the brewhouse, using a blend of pale barley malt and rye malt. Then we add the sour mash from the distillery, which lowers the pH of our brewery mash. By introducing sour mash before the boil instead of after it, we are able to create tartness in this brew without sourness. In the brewkettle, we use four additions of Nelson Sauvin, a dual-purpose hop from New Zealand. We also dry-hop with Nelson, which creates Zymaster 7's unique tropical aroma. An English ale yeast contributes dry, clean flavors.",
