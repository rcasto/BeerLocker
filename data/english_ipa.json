        "description": "The California Gold Rush lured thousands west to \"see the elephant,\" a 19th-century metaphor for the hopeful but risky pursuit of happiness, adventure, and fortune. As early as 1849, India Pale Ale - prepared by British brewers for export to India by adding dry hops to barrels of hoppy ale - was also heading west, from England around the Horn to San Francisco. Thirsty \u201849ers savored the best imported IPAs, but it wasn\u2019t until 1975 that Anchor, Americas' original craft brewery, pioneered the revival of dry-hopped handmade ales. Now, that tradition fast-forwards to an adventurous new brew: Anchor IPA\u2122.\r\n\r\nAnchor IPA\u2122 is made with 2-row barley malt and fresh whole-cone hops, its bright amber color, distinctively complex aroma, spiky bitterness, malty depth, and clean finish unite to create a uniquely flavorful, memorable, and timeless craft IPA.\r\n\r\nThe elephant you see on Anchor IPA\u2122 was hand-drawn by our label artist, James Stitt. To \"see the elephant\" was a popular 19th-century expression that originated with a tale that predates the California Gold Rush.\r\n\r\nThere once lived a farmer who had heard of elephants but had never seen one. He longed for the day when he might catch a glimpse of this rare, exotic creature. When the circus came to town, he loaded his wagon with fresh produce and headed to market. On the way, just as he'd hoped, he came across the circus parade, nobly led by an enormous elephant. The farmer was ecstatic, but his horses were terrified. They reared and bucked, overturning his wagon and scattering its precious contents in the road. \"I don\u2019t give a hoot,\" exclaimed the farmer. \"I have seen the elephant!\"\r\n\r\nThe elephant became the universal symbol of the Gold Rush, as evidenced by the journals, letters, and sketchbooks of the forty-niners. Whether or not they struck it rich in the diggings, those plucky pioneers would forever treasure their California adventure as the defining moment of their lives. Have you seen the elephant?",

Jobs was well and midden side by side. It was, however, aware that it was dangerous to drink the water. The food was smoked and salted. They ate meat, fish and cabbage.\r\n\r\nWhen brewing, the grist is dissolved in hot water. They found out quickly that if you boiled water and added hops to the beer, so we got a drink, you were not sick and could stay.\r\n\r\nEvery Dane drank in the Middle Ages 6-8 liters of beer a day! A common rural households with 15 persons should be provided with 90-120 liters of beer every day! Scullery was more important than the kitchen, and most often, a rural household have a girl who did not do anything other than produce malt and beer.\r\n\r\nOn Monastic can now see the ruins of both kitchen and utility room. Scullery was greater than the kitchen! There was Monastic 4 breweries that were in use at the same time.\r\n\r\nKlosterbryg is brewed with lager malt, wheat malt and caramel malt. It is seasoned with three different types of hops, which matches maltene. This is a beer with 6% alcohol, which is in the style of India Pale Ale.\r\n\r\nThere is only applied aroma hops. English Fuggles and Styrian Goldings with German Perle. Fuggles and Goldings are the two most classic English aroma hops. They give the beer a slightly perfumed scent, reminiscent of clementines.\r\n\r\nAroma hops makes the beer very soft in taste. With a fairly large dosage you do not experience the harsh bitterness that hops else can provide.\r\n\r\nThis is a beer that is suitable for fish and light meat dishes.

The large addition of Nugget and Amarillo Gold hops gives this beer a decisively bitter bite. After the initial bitterness subsides the drinker is directed to the fruity notes of the late addition Cascade hops leaving the drinker with a pleasant aftertaste. The use of crystal malts give this beer a light golden color, and the addition of rye malts aids in the body and head retention of the beer. Woodcutter Rye IPA is the strongest beer by both taste and ABV in the Branchline lineup and will be a favorite among the craft beer drinkers.",
