The craft brewing movement has long been called a \"revolution.\" But today the air is so thick with revolution, it's palpable. No longer is it only an awareness among the faithful; the unconverted are beginning to feel it as well. Denial and ignorance are disappearing in favor of opened eyes, curiosity and the sense that there's something larger out there. For far too long we have been lied to. For far too long we have been oppressed by the notion that dumbed-down lowest-common-denominator mediocrity was all that we could, and should, expect. You might think we're talking only about the world of brewing, but we're not. There is a myriad of products out there masquerading as cheeses, coffee, chocolates, breads...hell, there is stuff pretending to be \"food\" that our great-grandmothers would not recognize as such. Yet the craft brewing movement, together with the artisanal food movement, is making much progress. Where the industrial companies can't dismiss or bury us, they are attempting to copy us with cheap facsimiles. Yes, chances are if you are holding this bottle, you understand these things to be true about the world of brewing. You also likely understand the importance of our fight at Stone against accepted \"norms\" over the last 15 years. We believed that America was ready to embrace things made with artistry and passion. You have spoken. Your response has been clear. We are not merely consumers to be spoon-fed whatever commodities need to be unloaded for a profit. We have only just begun to move the needle of this revolution, and mediocrity still reigns. Consider that when you reject dumbed down, industrialized food and drink, you also support craft brewing. The line is nearly seamless; we are fighting the same battle. We will not win in our lifetime, as the powers are too entrenched, and the masses too fooled. And shackled. However, this is a revolution of ideas and of taste, and we will win. How do you want to be viewed by your children, and your children's children? As a hero, or as the oppressed? (Those that don't think they have been oppressed are already lost.) Ultimately, it's up to you to decide. We hope you'll stand with us. Strong and unyielding. You are needed. This bottle and its glorious contents are a celebration of you, brothers and sisters, and your importance in this fight. Cheers to all we've accomplished together in the past 15 years, and cheers to the adventure ahead!",

Yet, by inviting Kyle Hollingsworth, keyboardist for eclectic, jam-prone sextet, The String Cheese Incident, and Keri Kelli, wailing rock guitarist of Alice Cooper fame, we were able to make truly beautiful music. Turns out, these musicians have a great deal in common, both with each other and with Stone. We all enjoy turning things up to 11, and that is represented in this collaborative offering, an imperial India pale ale ably backed by Nugget, Comet and Calypso hops, and amplified care of a healthy dry-hopping with Vic's Secret, a new Australian hop, adding citrus and tropical fruit oomph. To give this modern masterpiece some soulful, classic character, we traced the roots of brewing to the days when Old World herbs were used to spice beers, adding in coriander and, a first for us, elderberries. To stand up to that sumptuous spice and blaring bitterness, we added golden naked oats, which are lightly roasted and add body and enhanced mouthfeel to the brew like a steady, unbreakable backbeat to an incendiary jam solo. Sit back, crank the volume and get lost in this operatic incarnation of genres combined in the name of invention.",

The beer is made with three malts in considerable additions that leave it with a more malty and sweet taste. There are five different hop additions that were carefully planed out to impart just enough bitterness to give it the body and depth that it needed without leaving you with the astringent and bitter aftertaste. We then added a plethora of English flavor and aroma hops that round out the floral and citrus esters. With the beer being so well balanced between bitter and sweet, we than added \\big sacks\"of bittering hops to the conditioning vessel to impart all the wonderful citrus and floral notes deep into the beer while leaving the bittering aspects of the hop behind. The result was a beer that makes you want to nose dive right in complimented by the well balanced taste of this wonderful brew.\"\"\"",

The white in this IIPA is from using a combination of wheat and rye which leave a cool protein haze.\r\n\r\nSo OK\u2013 what next?\r\n\r\nWe felt like this was a good opportunity to lean on some of our more tropical and floral hops, so we built the recipe around a variety of new-fangled German and New Zealand hops, as well as Amarillo, a favorite US variety that features dankly citric overtones. These aromatic elements go great with the dark tangerine notes of the Bavaria Mandarina, and the floral tropicality of NZ Motueka. The elements add up to a really neat combination of fruits and flowers and a really nice lot of Maui Wowie (you know what I mean).\r\n\r\nWhite Label. It\u2019s a thing. Hoppy, with a really interesting hop character, not too bitter, plus some interesting mouth-feel from the wheat and rye, as well as a nice crisp finish. Drink it.",

Earth Day, April 22nd, is the chance for everyone to make personal commitments to sustainability that lead to a larger, collective action. Eel River Brewing wants to show their commitment to sustainability and encourage others to do so by producing a sustainable, organic beer that promotes Earth Day and supports a like-minded non-profit.\r\n\r\nEarth Thirst, a Double IPA, will be brewed with over 3 pounds of hops per barrel throughout the brewing process, giving it a fresh and intense aroma. When it comes to Double IPAs, Head Brewer Mike Smith says that \u201cit\u2019s all about hop flavor and aroma from the dry hops. The flavor depends on the hops that you use. Since this beer uses Cascade and Centennial hops, it has a heavy floral aroma and citrus flavor.\u201d What makes this Double IPA unique is that it uses the highest quality, all organic ingredients - all from the Pacific Northwest. According to Smith, \u201cThe more locally produced ingredients are the more fresh they are when we get them, allowing the flavors to come out more.\u201d Earth Thirst is not only 100% organic, but 100% sustainable also as Eel River Brewing is 100% bio-mass powered. Eel River Brewing will begin shipping out their Earth Thirst beer at the end of March with only limited quantities available since Earth Thirst is a specialty release. To help promote organics and sustainability, a portion of the proceeds of Earth Thirst will be donated to CCOF.\r\n\r\nEel River Brewing chose to work with CCOF due to their practices and beliefs. CCOF is the only full-service organic certification agency and trade association that provides benefits on behalf of it members. CCOF certifies over 2,400 clients in the US, Mexico and Canada and its members and clients receive full trade association benefits, which include advocacy, education, marketing support and networking opportunities for the organic community (CCOF.org). Robin Boyle, Director of Marketing, Member Services and Development for CCOF, described the importance of CCOF and Eel River Brewing working together: \u201cWe are very excited to celebrate Earth Day with the first certified organic brewery. It\u2019s a fun campaign, and a reminder to us all to consider where our food comes from and how we can positively impact the environment by choosing organic.\u201d\r\n\r\nEel River Brewing Company is the first certified organic brewery in the United States. They produce seven year-round styles of beer as well as seasonal beers. Not only does Eel River Brewing have a commitment to handcrafted, traditional, organic craft beer, but they also believe in sustainable practices. The brewing facility is a reclaimed redwood lumber mill and is powered by 100% renewable energy, using bio-mass power. Eel River Brewing Company also has a taproom and grill at 1777 Alamar Way in Fortuna, CA where they offer all of their beers that they produce on tap.

We make it with six different malts and three types of hops, then dry-hop it with a mutha lode of Amarillo hops.\r\n\r\nIt features a gooey, resiny aroma and a luscious mouthfeel. Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.\r\n\r\nWe brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Colorado's first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.\r\n\r\nOriginally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.",

        "description": "H2P is a revamped iteration of the HTP IPA we have done in the past. For H2P this year I changed the recipe from the two previous batches, along with the hops and hop schedule. The past two batches featured Zythos and 7 C's opposite Simcoe. This year and in the future, it will be a single-hop Simcoe IPA. Since it's technically a different beer, but the soul of it is still the same, we are going to call this H2P going forward. As a former Pitt student, I know the Pitt faithful use HTP and H2P interchangeably, so it seemed fitting to change the \"T\" to a \"2\" for version 2.0. Inspired by the IPAs I fell in love with in California and deepened my college experience in South Oakland, H2P is a 8.0% west coast-style IPA brewed with four kinds of malted barley and a ridiculous amount of Simcoe hops with five kettle additions and two dry hops. The nose of the beer is rich in pine and fruit notes, with hints passion fruit, apricot, along with woodsy and floral undertones. Medium bodied, this beer starts with a mildly bitter taste that gives way to the pine and fruit notes found in the nose on the back end. H2P is a bright and crisp IPA that was designed to be highly drinkable, exceedingly flavorful and aromatic, but without being abrasively bitter. As production allows, we hope to continue to provide this beer to the Pittsburgh market and the Pitt faithful each year for Pittsburgh Craft Beer Week.",

This one is called Hopfenpop and will start shipping to accounts on Monday August 3rd.\r\nWe are calling this a \u201cpre-prohibition double IPA\u201d, part of a new series we\u2019re calling \u201cNever Upon a Time\u201d.\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d, you ask? Well, it\u2019s because we did an old-school, big boy cereal mash to give it exceptionally light body (for an 8% abv beer). A cereal mash uses corn grits, which are not really a craft brewing thing. In fact, we couldn\u2019t buy them from any of our regular suppliers, such is their \u201cbig beer\u201d stigma. Well, they have their uses! (one of which in this case was clogging up our lauter tun big time\u2026 but we\u2019ll come to that). The use of a cereal mash allows us to bring down the color and body of the beer, while keeping the ABV and allowing us to hop the beer \u201cstupidly.\u201d\r\nSo, we present to you a pale yellow, 8% abv, low bodied, refreshing, double IPA. The words refreshing and double IPA don\u2019t ordinarily go together, but we think you will agree they do here.\r\nThe hops are Mosaic and Sorachi Ace. And there\u2019s plenty of them. High aroma, fairly high bitterness.\r\nA good high-summer, hot-as-mars kind of a beer.\r\nThe name, of course, is Germany-inspired, and we might wear our lederhosen to the launch party.

Rather than oak, we\u2019ve selected the delicate wood of a fallen Virginia Tulip Poplar, which was TreeCycled by CitiWood and toasted for use in this hearty IPA. While this Poplar can no longer rustle in the wind or give shade, it is able to offer balance to the bright citrus and pine character from heaps of Cascade, Columbus and Summit hops with subtle notes of caramelized vanilla. And the tree was hoppy.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1800s, when the early IPAs were being shipped in wooden barrels from the breweries of Burton-on-Trent to thirsty British colonists in India, our Tulip Poplar was a mere sapling on the outskirts of Richmond, Virginia. On September 18, 2003, this towering Poplar prevailed to the fierce Hurricane Isabel and fell on Bell Creek Road. Richmond-based CitiWood Urban Forest Products helped us transform the wood from this fallen Poplar into custom designed flavor- and aroma-enhancing infusion sticks. Post fermentation, Hoplar is dry-hopped with a generous helping of whole-flower Cascade hops and conditioned on the toasted Poplar.\r\n\r\nHardywood Hoplar is mahogany in color with a hearty, tan head and offers an aroma of grapefruit br\u00fbl\u00e9e and pine needles, as well as delicate vanilla toffee and a hint of campfire. Medium- to full-bodied with assertive (100 IBUs) yet delightful hop bitterness, Hoplar is balanced with ample caramel malt backbone. A bit of earthy tannin from the Poplar harmonizes with the resinous hoppy character, which dissipates into a lingering finish. We believe this tree\u2019s spirit lives on in Hardywood Hoplar, and hope that the finished product rouses your spirit.",

Our brewers viewed it as a challenge to create a beer so complex and bizarre that it would make Franz himself proud.  We started with an Imperial IPA, then we transformed it into a rye IPA with a menacing portion of rye malt.  Then, we made it disorientingly black with some heavily roasted malts.  We needed more complexity, so we made it surreally smoky with cherry-wood smoked malts.  Lastly, we added 300 lbs of raspberries for fruitiness, and everybody knows you can\u2019t have a complex beer without wood, so we let sit on toasted American oak.

We bittered with generous portions Magnum, Centennial and Cascade hops. The finish was made luscious with the addition of Warrior and Citra after chilling the wort. This IPA is sweet and full of citrus flavors. Watch out; it does pack a wallop at 10.3% ABV.",

In response, we created Lost Continent in 2009 and updated it for 2010. This year's version is brewed with well over three pounds of hops per barrel in the kettle and another half-pound per barrel of \u201cdry hops\u201d in two additions during conditioning. A revised fermentation program has produced a more traditional Double IPA flavor profile--drier, less malty, more hoppy.\r\n\r\nWe use only American Pacific Northwest hops. Galena hops are added early in the boil for smooth, balanced bitterness. We add Columbus, Centennial and Amarillo later in the boil for flavor, and Columbus, Centennial and Simcoe in the whirlpool for aroma.\r\n\r\nFor even more aroma, we dry-hop with Summit, Columbus, Amarillo and Cascade hops in the conditioning tank, and dry-hop again right before bottling with whole-flower Cascade hops. The result is fruity, floral and complex, with notews of tangerine zest and fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice.\r\n\r\nIdaho 2-Row Brewers\u2019 Malt and German CaraHell and Vienna malts give this ale its lovely pale copper hue, with flavors of orange marmalade and dried apricots, supported by a strong backbone of hoppy bitterness.",

        "description": "Pliny the Elder is brewed with Amarillo, Centennial, CTZ, and Simcoe hops. It is well-balanced with malt, hops, and alcohol, slightly bitter with a fresh hop aroma of floral, citrus, and pine. Best enjoyed FRESH! That is why we make it in such limited supply. Actual bottling date is printed on each bottle!\r\n \r\nWhere did we come up with this name? Back in the year 2000, our friend, Vic Kralj, who owns the Bistro in Hayward, California, decided to have his first ever Double IPA festival. Vic invited 10 breweries, 6 of whom (including us) had to brew something special for him since we had nothing that would fall under this style category. Vinnie had made a Double IPA at Blind Pig in 1994, but was not brewing one at Russian River Brewing at the time. He had an idea for the recipe, but not a name. After much research in beer books, brainstorming, and deliberation, we came up with \"Pliny the Elder\". Pliny, the man, lived in the first century- 23 to 79 A.D. According to our brewing references, he and his contemporaries either created the botanical name or at least wrote about Lupus Salictarius, or hops, currently known as Humulus Lupulus. That was a very early reference to an important part of any Double IPA! Pliny the beer has now become one of our flagship brews!\r\n \r\nPliny the Elder was immortalized by his nephew, Pliny the Younger, who wrote about his uncle succumbing to ash and smoke during the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D. while rescuing people. Cheers to the scholar, historian, officer, writer, and Roman Naturalist- Pliny the Elder!\r\nAvailability",

At Amager Brewery we say \"fuck all the crises and let's have some serious beer!\" With Rated XX 2009 we will once again prove that despite rumors to the contrary, then there are plenty of hops to get out there if you which brews just want it. This beer is a tribute to the beer perhaps most precious ingredient, and it is a tribute to all the 'hopheads' who knows how to enjoy it. Again we have gone berserk and emptied hop room at the brewery. Amager Rated XX 2009 contains a unique composition of no less than 23 hops: Centennial, Hallertau Mittelfr\u00fch, Brewers Gold, Crystal, Simcoe, Pearl, Mt. Hood, Hersbrucker, Challenger, Fuggles, Liberty, Styrian Goldings, Columbus, Chinook, Amarillo, Bramling Cross, East Kent Goldings, Willamette, Palisade, Saaz, First Gold, Pacific Gem and Northern Brewer. Yep, we admit it outright, it's a hop-orgy that will separate the wheat from the chaff among beer lovers - even among those who have believed that their taste buds could easily cope with a violent Double IPA. When it comes to bitterness, then we have given up trying to figure it out, because it is quite impossible. But we're pretty sure that Amager Rated XX 2009, one of the world's most bitter beer.

She thought it was a piece of Vienna malt and munched joyfully on the small pill. Joy was soon turned to horror when the cruel truth with one went up for the nice, elderly lady. She's still alive, but her taste was forever scorched away at it, there just should have been a pleasant day at the brewery.\r\nThe above story is true down to the smallest point, and the lady is certainly not proud of it. But I retell it to warn of the total carelessness with hops, which takes place on Amager Brewery. A year brewed the a heated double IPA with 20 different hops. The following year would bl\u00e6rer\u00f8vene surpass themselves and sprinkled 23 hops in the keg. This time, they ended up at 30 hops, yes you read that right. Three to ten hops. And now it's not fun anymore, it's just perverse. Lads know obviously not what they're doing - it is pure Disney. The said lady would go in acute convulsions if she so much as sniffed at this beer. And you tend to hop shock, we can not recommend this beer. It is hereby Rated XxX - then you are even asking for it!",

Married with other high alpha hops, with almost two pounds of hops added per barrel produced, AIA has an intense staying power in the back of the throat. After a long discussion between Chris, John and the brewers, they dubbed this hop flavor stinky grapefruit with a hint of perfume. The dark color might lead you to believe the some malt may shine through; but no, the hops are the true player in this ale.\n \nScratch #20 has a dual role, also serving at The Drafting Room\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?\u00a2s Anniversary Ale for 2009. We brewed a bit more to serve the brewery and The Drafting Room, but get it while when you see it. Before this intense hop flavor subsides, this beer will be sold out.",

Unfiltered like nearly all of our Scratch beers, #38 has stunning clarity: even our lab guy thought we filtered this one!\r\n \r\nDue to some serious dry-hopping, #38 has a predominantly grassy citrus nose, and the flavor follows suit, overwhelming nearly all the bready Munich malt used in this brew. #38 leaves a lingering grassy bitterness on the tongue, making sure you know a lot of hops were sacrificed for this brew.\r\n\r\nHops: Centennial, Chinook",

The best of which involved a deadbeat considering resistance to his arrest. With baton drawn, Charlie demanded \"Sit down or I'll SIT YOU DOWN!\" Since the episode aired over 10 years ago, we've uttered the line a million times to one another and laughed every time. We're paying tribute to that line by using it to name our Imperial IPA. A big beer that will sit you down if you don't do it first. Ha. Call it \u201cSit Down\u201d for short.\r\n\r\n As for the beer itself, the intent is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of the hops. We dry hopped it with over a pound of hops per barrel of beer. It\u2019s gold in color and the floral ester aroma is high. The hop bitterness is high, but not at all harsh. The hop flavor is high, fresh, and lively. Yet with all of our beers, it\u2019s all about balance and this one is no exception. The malt character is fairly high and provides a tremendously full mouthfeel. Finally, the alcohol in this beer is intentionally present (and delicious).",

Our Stone 10th Anniversary Ale weighs in at 10% alcohol by volume (perfect for a 10th anniversary beer), and has a little more color and malt character than our other IPAs. In addition to using the new Summit hop variety in the brewhouse to provide the powerful bitterness, we went back through our records and found some of our favorite hops over the years, and used them to flavor this brew, including Chinook, Crystal, and large doses of Simcoe in the dry-hop to provide a huge, complex, piney, fruity and floral hop character.

A sun pillar looks like a thin column that extends vertically above the sun. The sun pillar is prominently visible when the Sun is low or lies below the horizon. It normally forms an arc that extends from five to ten degrees beyond the solar disc.  Sun pillars are formed by reflection from ice crystals with roughly horizontal faces.\r\nThe Beer:\r\nThe Sun Pillar Double IPA is a more robust version of our 3 Needles IPA.

The result is a hybrid ale that is a deep reddish copper with a medium body, rich roasty malts, and zesty, citrusy hops on the palette. It has a long bitter finish that derives from both the roasted malts and the 47 IBU. Super Snapper was brewed to commemorate Arbor Brewing Company and the Brewpub\u2019s tenth anniversary.",

As a double IPA, this beast employs a sizable malt bill, but it is the crazy amount of hops added to the boil every 4 minutes, for 120 minutes, that really make this beer special. Fruity, floral, and piney hop flavors penetrate throughout the caramelized malt profile. Liberator is a well-balanced, full bodied brew that has a bitter finish due to the post fermentation addition of lemon and orange zest. The original batch brewed on the Bellaire system had 42lbs of hops in it, compared to Huma, which has around 20lbs of hops per batch. Today\u2019s Elk Rapids batches have up to 138lbs of hops. The name, Liberator, came from Joe\u2019s name for the Short\u2019s employees who carry out our company\u2019s mission statement as \u201cBeer Liberators\u201d, freeing the masses from their misconceptions surrounding beer.",

Happy 5th anniversary!\r\n\r\nFive years ago we opened a little brewpub in the downstairs corner of The Fort George Building in Historic Downtown Astoria. Today we take up nearly and entire city-block: , three buildings, two breweries, two bars, an event space, and a canning line with all run by almost 50 hard-working employees. \r\n\r\nWith a beer in the plans for almost as long as we\u2019ve been operational, this is our expression of what a brewery can accomplish in five short but intense years. \r\n\r\nMay we still be pleasing your palate in another five.",
