The beer finishes crisp and dry, with a very mild training bitterness.\r\nOther Notes:\r\nFirst off this beer is not a traditional IPA, so those expecting a huge nit of bitterness will be disappointed. Session IPAs are lighter bodied and lighter in alcohol than a normal American IPA. Hop, and bitterness is used in beer to balance the alcohol. In a beer with a lower abv, the IBU must be lower as well in order for the beer to maintain its balance. In a session IPA very little bittering hop is used. Hops are added very late in the brewing process to create a strong aroma and flavour profile. This style is intended to a hop forward light beer, something that is well suited to the patio and hot weather. The session in the name refers to this style being a beer that one could consume in larger amounts due to the lower alcohol content.",

Folly\u2019s Pride post Folly\u2019s Pride, our summer session ale, aka grapefruit blonde, is out on the market and getting a tremendous response. We love this beer, made with 10 lbs of fresh organic grapefruit zest. There was an article in the City Paper about our collaboration with the Juice Joint to make the beer. Re-selling the grapefruits to an organic juicer was the only way we could make this work, so we did it! Look for Folly\u2019s Pride to be available all summer as a seasonal through September.",

For Stone Go To IPA, we are embracing our hop obsession in a new way, funneling an abundance of lupulin-borne bitterness into a \"session\" IPA delivering all the fruity, piney character of a much bigger IPA. To accomplish this, we employed \"hop bursting,\" a new technique wherein an irrational amount of hops is added during the final phase of the brewing process to coax out extreme flavors and aromas while also imparting a burst of desirably pleasant bitterness. The result is an Alpha-acid-rich beer that fans can enjoy more of without missing out on the assertive hop character you, like us, crave. So, sit back and go two with your new everyday go-to IPA and bask along with us in the glory of the almighty hop.",

        "description": "Hoppy Diver is a Session IPA that was inspired by a trip to the hop harvest in Yakima, Washington. Imagine yourself surrounded by mountains of hops, with an aroma so enticing you feel like diving in and rolling around in all that delicious piney, danky goodness. Well that is what our Head Brewer Brannon Radicke did\u2026he dove right in! On the trip to the hop harvest, we got a chance to try a new experimental hop that has yet to be named. It\u2019s just numbered hop #07270. We were intrigued and just had to try it. Thus our Session IPA was born.\n\nHoppy Diver Session IPA was brewed with only two-row pale malt and the experimental #07270 and Mosaic. Full of herbal and citrusy notes, Hoppy Diver has all the hop flavor you\u2019d want from an IPA but with a lower ABV. So pull a seat at the bar, and enjoy this limited-release beer on draft, and imagine yourself in a mountain of hops!",

The beer of choice turned out to be \"Orange Crush\" a so called Session IPA - low in alcohol and potency, but high in drinkability. Heavily dry-hopped with the juiciest of American aroma hops: Citra, Mosaic and Simcoe and a solid dose of our secret ingredient, a super fragrant brand of American orange peel.

Philadelphia Runner\u2019s Ale is a 4.5% session IPA that will be available on draft only at the Post Race Street Festival on East Passyunk and at participating bars and restaurants. A research study conducted by Dr. Manuel J Castillo, Professor of Medical Physiology School of Medicine at the University of Grenada discovered that beer has positive re hydration effects after physical exertion.

It boasts complex aromatics of citrus and tropical fruits, finishing with the typical clean, refreshing character for which our beers are known. The very first keg of this beer was served in the United States Capitol to members of the U.S. Congress Ways & Means committee. Both Democrats and Republicans found that it was a beer that all could agree upon.",

The grain bill is simple: the majority being floor-malted two-row pale malt with a touch of dextrin malt and crystal malt (30\u00b0 L).",
