# BeerLocker

Uses data from the [BreweryDB API](http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs)

To use the *get_beer.py* script you must have an API key for an app with [BreweryDB](http://www.brewerydb.com/developers)

This API key must be stored in a file in the root of this project called *config.json*

An example of the contents of this file
is shown below:  
`
{
    "api_key": "<your-key-here>"
}
`
